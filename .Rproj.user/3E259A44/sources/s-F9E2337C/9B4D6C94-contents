There are different trends, health wise, depending on where a person lives. This
could be demographic or location wise. To look further into what exact trend
is occurring I will be looking at nine different types of sicknesses.

* Asthma
* Carbon Monoxide Poising
* COPD
* Drinking Water Quality
* Food Safety
* Heart Disease
* Heat Stress Illness
* Infectious Diseases
* Mortality

The data will be collected from Arizona Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) 
Explorer. This website is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with filters to 
look at the different statistics of each sickness. The data is collected from
different hospitals in Arizona. I will be specifically looking at county based
information. To look more at the demographic information in the counties I then
moved to collected information from the Census Database. I will be collecting
county based data for the American Community Service (ACS), which has yearly
data rather than every ten years. This will be able to match up better with the
EPHT data. The ACS only has information with the top ten populated counties.

* Apache
* Cochise
* Coconino
* Maricopa
* Mohave
* Navajo
* Pima
* Pinal
* Yavapi
* Yuma

This will exclude five counties in Arizona, but I feel that the EPHT data is 
more accurate for the top ten counties. 

My goals for this project is to use new resources, to myself, to collect the 
data from the two separate sources listed above. For the EPHT data, I will be
web scrapping the data through Python. Once the data is collected it will
transferred to R studio for cleaning and organization. For the ACS data, I will 
be collecting it through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) calls made in the Anaconda
terminal. Once the data is collected it will be moved to pgAdmin, a PostgreSQL
application. There will be separate tables in one database holding the data.
It will be cleaned and organized in the application as well. Then, from R 
studio it will be connected to the database in order to interact with the EPHT 
data. For both sources, the data will be collected from 2005 to 2019.
